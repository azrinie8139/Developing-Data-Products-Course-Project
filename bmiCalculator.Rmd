## Overview

This is a presentation about my Developing Data Products Course Project.

The project is Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator.

## BMI Calculator

How the BMI Calculator work?

1. User will enter their height in centimeter and weight in kilogram
2. Then, the apps will calculate the BMI Index by using formula weight / (height(meter)^2)
3. Beside that, the apps also will tell the user BMI Category:
  - BMI < 18.5 = Under Weight
  - BMI 18.5-24.9 = Normal Weight
  - BMI 25-29.9 = Over Weight
  - BMI >30 = Obesity

## The Output From The Apps

The apps will show the height and weight entered by user and also BMI Index and BMI Category that calculate by the apps.

## Thank You
